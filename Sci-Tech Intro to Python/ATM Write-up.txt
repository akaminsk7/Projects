Intro to Python: ATM Project Outline

For this project, you will utilize data input, else-if latters and data modification in order to create a working ATM. 
Below outlines the steps necesarry to complete the task.
1)	Have the user create a username and password and create an arbitrary starting balance
2) 	Ask the user to sign into the ATM
3) 	Upon a sucessful sign-in, show the user their balance and ask them to decide if they want to withdrawl or deposit money.
	For unsecessful login attempts, inform the user of their error and end the program EX: Tell user if they entered the wrong username or password
4a) For Withdrawls, ask the user how much they would like to withdrawl and ensure that the user has enough money to complete the transaction. 
	If the user does not have enough money to complete the transaction, inform the user and end the program
4b) For Deposit, ask the user how much they would like to deposit and add that amount to their balance.
5)	Thank the user for using the atm if a successful transaction occurs(Correct username and password, Correct Withdrawl or deposit)

Additional Challenges:
1)	Use a while loop in order to keep allowing the user to perform transactions until they no longer want to make withdrawls or deposits
2) 	Use a For-Loop to allow users 5 attempts to type in the correct username and password before the program terminates
3)	Use either a For-Loop or a While loop in order to allow the user to input correct data if a mistake was made
	EX: Asking the user how much they would like to withdrawl until a valid amount is selected.
